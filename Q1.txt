# 1.    Design the pseudocode of the Euclidean Algorithm.

# ANSWER:

Function EuclideanAlgorithm(a, b):
    # While b is not equal to 0, continue the loop
    while b != 0 do
        # Storing the current value of b in a temporary variable
        temp = b
        # Updating b to the remainder when a is divided by b
        b = a % b
        # Updating a to the previous value of b
        a = temp
    # Once b becomes 0, return the final value of a which is the GCD
    return a
